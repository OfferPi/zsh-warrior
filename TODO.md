# Plugin To-Do List

A checklist of improvements and features to add.

- [ ] **Add a “super mode”** that uses a different model and context  
  Allow switching to a higher-capacity model.  
  Provide extra context to the model in this mode.

- [ ] **Include environment information** in the LLM prompt  
  Inject details about the system into prompts for better responses.
  Inject default editor.
  Inject OS Version.
  Inject Packet manager.
  Maybe inject available commands.

- [ ] Automate setup 
  Download models when not available
  Install Ollama when not available
  Ask for installation of venv, instead of just creating it
